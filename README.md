# PixelCipher

## Summary

**PixelCipher** is a Python tool for image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation techniques. This program enables users to encrypt and decrypt images by either swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Input an image file, choose an encryption method, and specify a key to perform the encryption or decryption process.

## Features

- Support for two encryption methods: swapping pixel values and applying a mathematical operation.
- User-friendly interface for providing the image file path, encryption method, and key.
- Encryption and decryption functions utilizing pixel manipulation for enhanced image security.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pillow`.
3. Run the `PixelCipher.py` script.
4. Input the image file path, choose an encryption method, and provide a key.
5. The program will generate encrypted and decrypted images based on the chosen method and key.
